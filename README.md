# Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)

Add the absolute path of directory containing the function files using addpath() function in Command Window of Octave.<br />
Example:
```
addpath('~/Documents/FolderName/')
```
Install the signal package in Octave if not installed already.<br />

Run the <b>mfcc.m</b> file to record audio and plot its MFCC. You can modify the number of coefficients to compute, choose a custom audio file instead of recording audio, change overlap %, etc in the code.<br />

For a detailed theory on steps to compute MFCC, refer http://practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/guide-mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients-mfccs/ <br />
