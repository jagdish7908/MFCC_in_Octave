# Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)

Add the absolute path of directory containing the function files using addpath() function in Command Window of Octave.<br />
Example:
```
addpath('~/Documents/FolderName/')
```
Install the signal package in Octave if not installed already.<br />

Run the <b>mfcc.m</b> file to record audio and plot its MFCC. You can modify the number of coefficients to compute, choose a custom audio file instead of recording audio, change overlap %, etc in the code.<br />
